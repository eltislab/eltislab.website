Under nitrogen-limitation, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 grown on benzoate, an analog of lignin depolymn. products, accumulated triacylglycerols (TAGs) to 55% of its dry wt. during transition to stationary phase, with the predominant fatty acids being C16:0 and C17:0. Transcriptomic analyses of RHA1 grown under conditions of N-limitation and N-excess revealed 1826 dysregulated genes. Genes whose transcripts were more abundant under N-limitation included those involved in ammonium assimilation, benzoate catabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway. Of the 16 atf genes potentially encoding diacylglycerol O-acyltransferases, atf8 transcripts were the most abundant during N-limitation (∼50-fold more abundant than during N-excess). Consistent with Atf8 being a physiol. determinant of TAG accumulation, a Δatf8 mutant accumulated 70% less TAG than wild-type RHA1 while atf8 overexpression increased TAG accumulation 20%. Genes encoding type-2 phosphatidic acid phosphatases were not significantly expressed. By contrast, 3 genes potentially encoding phosphatases of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily and that cluster with, or are fused with other Kennedy pathway genes were dysregulated. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of TAG metab. in mycolic acid-contg. bacteria and provide a framework to engineer strains for increased TAG prodn. [on SciFinder(R)]},

  abstract = {Summary : Pseudomonas putida DOC21, a soil-dwelling proteobacterium, catabolizes a variety of steroids and bile acids. Transposon mutagenesis and bioinformatics analyses identified four clusters of steroid degrdn. (std) genes encoding a single catabolic pathway. The latter includes three predicted acyl-CoA synthetases encoded by stdA1, stdA2 and stdA3 resp. The ΔstdA1 and ΔstdA2 deletion mutants were unable to assimilate cholate or other bile acids but grew well on testosterone or 4-androstene-3,17-dione (AD). In contrast, a ΔstdA3 mutant grew poorly in media contg. either testosterone or AD. When cells were grown with succinate in the presence of cholate, ΔstdA1 accumulated Δ1/4-3-ketocholate and Δ1,4-3-ketocholate, whereas ΔstdA2 only accumulated 7α,12α-dihydroxy-3-oxopregna-1,4-diene-20-carboxylate (DHOPDC). When incubated with testosterone or bile acids, ΔstdA3 accumulated 3aα-H-4α(3'propanoate)-7aβ-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione (HIP) or the corresponding hydroxylated deriv. Biochem. analyses revealed that StdA1 converted cholate, 3-ketocholate, Δ1/4-3-ketocholate, and Δ1,4-3-ketocholate to their CoA thioesters, while StdA2 transformed DHOPDC to DHOPDC-CoA. In contrast, purified StdA3 catalyzed the CoA thioesterification of HIP and its hydroxylated derivs. Overall, StdA1, StdA2 and StdA3 are acyl-CoA synthetases required for the complete degrdn. of bile acids: StdA1 and StdA2 are involved in degrading the C-17 acyl chain, whereas StdA3 initiates degrdn. of the last two steroid rings. The study highlights differences in steroid catabolism between Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. [on SciFinder(R)]},

IsdB is critically important both for in vitro growth on Hb and in infection models and is also highly up-regulated in blood, serum, and tissue infection models, indicating a key role of this receptor in bacterial virulence. However, structural information for IsdB is limited. We present here a crystal structure of a complex between human Hb and IsdB. In this complex, the α subunits of Hb are refolded with the heme displaced to the interface with IsdB. We also observe that atypical residues of Hb, His58 and His89 of αHb, coordinate to the heme iron, which is poised for transfer into the heme-binding pocket of IsdB. Moreover, the porphyrin ring interacts with IsdB residues Tyr440 and Tyr444. Previously, Tyr440 was obsd. to coordinate heme iron in an IsdB·heme complex structure. A Y440F/Y444F IsdB variant we produced was defective in heme transfer yet formed a stable complex with Hb (Kd = 6 ± 2 μm) in soln. with spectroscopic features of the bis-His species obsd. in the crystal structure. Haptoglobin binds to a distinct site on Hb to inhibit heme transfer to IsdB and growth of S. aureus, and a ternary complex of IsdB·Hb·Hp was obsd. We propose a model for IsdB heme transfer from Hb that involves unfolding of Hb and heme iron ligand exchange. [on SciFinder(R)]},

In this system, IsdB is a cell wall-anchored surface protein that contains 2 near iron transporter (NEAT) domains, one of which binds heme. IsdB rapidly exts. heme from Hb and transfers it to IsdA for relay into the bacterial cell. Using a series of recombinant IsdB constructs that included at least one NEAT domain, the authors demonstrated that both domains were required to bind Hb with high affinity (Kd = 0.42 μM) and to ext. heme from Hb. Moreover, IsdB extd. heme only from oxidized metHb, although it also bound oxyHb and the Hb-CO complex. In a reconstituted model of the biol. heme relay pathway, IsdB catalyzed the transfer of heme from metHb to IsdA with a Km for metHb of 0.75 μN and a kcat of 0.22 s-1. The latter was consistent with the transfer of heme from metHb to IsdB being the rate-limiting step. With both NEAT domains and the linker region present in a single contiguous polypeptide, high-affinity Hb binding was achieved, rapid heme uptake was obsd., and multiple turnovers of heme extn. from metHb and transfer to IsdA were conducted, representing all known Hb-heme uptake functions of the full-length IsdB protein.

FadD3 is one of four predicted acyl-CoA synthetases potentially involved in cholesterol catabolism. A ΔfadD3 mutant of RHA1 grew on cholesterol to half the yield of wild-type and accumulated 3aα-H-4α(3'-propanoate)-7aβ-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione (HIP), consistent with the catabolism of half the steroid mol. This phenotype was rescued by fadD3 of Mtb. Moreover, RHA1 but not ΔfadD3 grew on HIP. Purified FadD3Mtb catalyzed the ATP-dependent CoA thioesterification of HIP and its hydroxylated analogs, 5α-OH HIP and 1β-OH HIP. The apparent specificity const. (kcat/Km) of FadD3Mtb for HIP was 7.3 ± 0.3 × 105 M-1s-1, 165 times higher than for 5α-OH HIP, while the apparent Km for CoASH was 110 ± 10 μM. In contrast to enzymes involved in the catabolism of rings A and B, FadD3Mtb did not detectably transform a metabolite with a partially degraded C17 side-chain. Overall, these results indicate that FadD3 is a HIP-CoA synthetase that initiates catabolism of steroid rings C and D after side-chain degrdn. is complete.

  abstract = {Bacterial steroid catabolism is an important component of the global carbon cycle and has applications in drug synthesis. Pathways for this catabolism involve multiple acyl CoA (CoA) synthetases, which activate alkanoate substituents for β-oxidn. The functions of these synthetases are poorly understood. We enzymically characterized four distinct acyl-CoA synthetases from the cholate catabolic pathway of Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 and the cholesterol catabolic pathway of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Phylogenetic anal. of 70 acyl-CoA synthetases predicted to be involved in steroid metab. revealed that the characterized synthetases each represent an orthologous class with a distinct function in steroid side-chain degrdn. The synthetases were specific for the length of alkanoate substituent. FadD19 from M. tuberculosis H37Rv (FadD19Mtb) transformed 3-oxo-4-cholesten-26-oate (kcat/Km = 0.33 × 105 ± 0.03 × 105 M-1 s-1) and represents orthologs that activate the C8 side chain of cholesterol. Both CasGRHA1 and FadD17Mtb are steroid-24-oyl-CoA synthetases. CasG and its orthologs activate the C5 side chain of cholate, while FadD17 and its orthologs appear to activate the C5 side chain of one or more cholesterol metabolites. CasIRHA1 is a steroid-22-oyl-CoA synthetase, representing orthologs that activate metabolites with a C3 side chain, which accumulate during cholate catabolism. CasI had similar apparent specificities for substrates with intact or extensively degraded steroid nuclei, exemplified by 3-oxo-23,24-bisnorchol-4-en-22-oate and 1β(2'-propanoate)-3aα-H-4α(3"-propanoate)-7aβ-methylhexahydro-5-indanone (kcat/Km = 2.4 × 105 ± 0.1 × 105 M-1 s-1 and 3.2 × 105 ± 0.3 × 105 M-1 s-1, resp.).

  abstract = {Most mycolic acid-contg. actinobacteria and some proteobacteria use steroids as growth substrates, but the catabolism of the last two steroid rings has yet to be elucidated. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, this pathway includes virulence determinants and has been proposed to be encoded by the KstR2-regulated genes, which include a predicted CoA (CoA) transferase gene (ipdAB) and an acyl-CoA reductase gene (ipdC). In the presence of cholesterol, ΔipdC and ΔipdAB mutants of either M. tuberculosis or Rhodococcus jostii strain RHA1 accumulated previously undescribed metabolites: 3aα-H-4α(carboxyl-CoA)-5-hydroxy-7aβ-methylhexahydro-1-indanone (5-OH HIC-CoA) and (R)-2-(2-carboxyethyl)-3-methyl-6-oxocyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA (COCHEA-CoA), resp. A ΔfadE32 mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis accumulated 4-methyl-5-oxo-octanedioic acid (MOODA). Incubation of synthetic 5-OH HIC-CoA with purified IpdF, IpdC, and enoyl-CoA hydratase 20 (EchA20), a crotonase superfamily member, yielded COCHEA-CoA and, upon further incubation with IpdAB and a CoA thiolase, yielded MOODA-CoA. Based on these studies, we propose a pathway for the final steps of steroid catabolism in which the 5-member ring is hydrolyzed by EchA20, followed by hydrolysis of the 6-member ring by IpdAB. Metabolites accumulated by ΔipdF and ΔechA20 mutants support the model. The conservation of these genes in known steroid-degrading bacteria suggests that the pathway is shared. This pathway further predicts that cholesterol catabolism yields four propionyl-CoAs, four acetyl-CoAs, one pyruvate, and one succinyl-CoA. Finally, a ΔipdAB M. tuberculosis mutant did not survive in macrophages and displayed severely depleted CoASH levels that correlated with a cholesterol-dependent toxicity. Our results together with the developed tools provide a basis for further elucidating bacterial steroid catabolism and virulence determinants in M. tuberculosis. [on SciFinder(R)]},

KstR2, a TetR family repressor (TFR), regulates the expression of 15 genes encoding enzymes that catabolize the last half of the cholesterol mol., represented by 3aα-H-4α(3'-propanoate)-7aβ-methylhexahydro-1,5-indane-dione (HIP). Binding of KstR2 to its operator sequences is relieved upon binding of HIP-CoA. A 1.6-Å resoln. crystal structure of the KstR2Mtb·HIP-CoA complex reveals that the KstR2Mtb dimer accommodates two mols. of HIP-CoA. Each ligand binds in an elongated cleft spanning the dimerization interface such that the HIP and CoA moieties interact with different KstR2Mtb protomers. In isothermal titrn. calorimetry studies, the dimer bound 2 equiv of HIP-CoA with high affinity (Kd = 80 ± 10 nm) but bound neither HIP nor CoASH. Substitution of Arg-162 or Trp-166, residues that interact, resp., with the diphosphate and HIP moieties of HIP-CoA, dramatically decreased the affinity of KstR2Mtb for HIP-CoA but not for its operator sequence. The variant of R162M that decreased the affinity for HIP-CoA (ΔΔG = 13 kJ mol-1) is consistent with the loss of three hydrogen bonds as indicated in the structural data. A 24-bp operator sequence bound two dimers of KstR2. Structural comparisons with a ligand-free rhodococcal homolog and a DNA-bound homolog suggest that HIP-CoA induces conformational changes of the DNA-binding domains of the dimer that preclude their proper positioning in the major groove of DNA. The results provide insight into KstR2-mediated regulation of expression of steroid catabolic genes and the determinants of ligand binding in TFRs. [on SciFinder(R)]},

IpdAB, found in all steroid-degrading bacteria and a determinant of pathogenicity, has been implicated in the hydrolysis of the last steroid ring. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that IpdAB orthologs form a clade of CoA transferases (CoTs). In a coupled assay with a thiolase, IpdAB transformed the cholesterol catabolite (R)-2-(2-carboxyethyl)-3-methyl-6-oxocyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA (COCHEA-CoA) and CoASH to 4-methyl-5-oxo-octanedioyl- CoA (MOODA-CoA) and acetyl-CoA with high specificity (kcat/Km = 5.8 ± 0.8 × 104 M-1·s-1). The structure of MOODA-CoA was consistent with IpdAB hydrolyzing COCHEA-CoA to a β-keto-thioester, a thiolase substrate. Contrary to characterized CoTs, IpdAB exhibited no activity toward small CoA thioesters. Further, IpdAB lacks the catalytic glutamate residue that is conserved in the β-subunit of characterized CoTs and a glutamyl-CoA intermediate was not trapped during turnover. By contrast, Glu105A, conserved in the a-subunit of IpdAB, was essential for catalysis. A crystal structure of the IpdAB·COCHEA-CoA complex, solved to 1.4 Å, revealed that Glu105A is positioned to act as a catalytic base. Upon titrn. with COCHEACoA, the E105AA variant accumulated a yellow-colored species (λmax = 310 nm; Kd = 0.4 ± 0.2 μM) typical of β-keto enolates. In the presence of D2O, IpdAB catalyzed the deuteration of COCHEACoA adjacent to the hydroxylation site at rates consistent with kcat. Based on these data and addnl. IpdAB variants, we propose a retro-Claisen condensation-like mechanism for the IpdAB-mediated hydrolysis of COCHEA-CoA.

Cholesterol and cholate induced distinct sets of steroid-degrading enzymes encoded by paralogous gene clusters, consistent with transcriptomic studies.

By contrast, how a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme could catalyze such a hydroxylation was unknown. Here, we investigate RohP, a PLP-dependent enzyme that converts L-arginine to (S)-4-hydroxy-2-ketoarginine. We det. that the RohP reaction consumes oxygen with stoichiometric release of H2O2. To understand this unusual chem., we obtain ∼1.5 Å resoln. structures that capture intermediates along the catalytic cycle. Our data suggest that RohP carries out a four-electron oxidn. and a stereospecific alkene hydration to give the (S)-configured product. Together with our earlier studies on an O2, PLP-dependent L-arginine oxidase, our work suggests that there is a shared pathway leading to both oxidized and hydroxylated products from L-arginine.

We found cholesteryl ester (CE) formation in members of the actinobacterial genera Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, and Amycolatopsis, as well as several members of the proteobacterial Cellvibrionales order. CEs maximally accumulated under nitrogen-limiting conditions, suggesting that steryl ester formation plays a crucial role for storing excess energy and carbon under adverse conditions. Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 was able to synthesize phytosteryl and cholesteryl esters, the latter reaching up to 7% of its cellular dry weight and 69% of its lipid droplets. Purified lipid droplets from RHA1 contained CEs, free cholesterol, and triacylglycerols. In addition, we found formation of CEs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis when it was grown with cholesterol plus an additional fatty acid substrate.

Most characterized MCP hydrolases are serine-dependent, with hydrolysis proceeding via enol-keto tautomerization followed by an acyl-enzyme intermediate. In contrast, LigY is Zn2+-dependent, with hydrolysis proposed to proceed via tautomerization followed by formation of a gem-diol intermediate. Transient-state kinetic anal. of DCHM-HOPDA turnover revealed the formation of an intermediate possessing a bathochromically shifted spectrum (λmax = 508 nm), similar to that of the ESred intermediate obsd. during tautomerization in serine-dependent hydrolases. Neither the formation (1/τ1 ≈ 137 s-1) nor the decay (1/τ2 ≈ 23 s-1) of ESred was rate-limiting (kcat = 9.7 ± 0.3 s-1). Furthermore, the rate of ESred decay was 3.4-fold slower in deuterated buffer, suggesting a proton-transfer reaction consistent with substrate ketonization. LigY turned over 4-carboxy-HOPDA but not 4-methyl-HOPDA, suggesting that the carboxylate is essential for catalysis. Titrn. of LigY with 4-methyl-HOPDA yielded a species with a spectrum similar to that of ESred (Kd = 25 ± 1 μM). A 2.4-Å crystal structure of the LigY·4-methyl-HOPDA complex, which also had a spectrum like ESred, revealed the ligand coordinated to the Zn2+ in a bidentate manner via the 1-carboxylate and 2-oxo groups. Overall, the data support a mechanism in which the metallocenter primarily catalyzes substrate tautomerization and the water required for the hydrolytic half-reaction is activated in a substrate-assisted manner. This study provides insight into C-C bond hydrolases as well as the versatility of the catalytic machinery of metallohydrolases. [on SciFinder(R)]},

In this pathway, LigY is proposed to catalyze the hydrolysis of the meta-cleavage product (MCP) 4,11-dicarboxy-8-hydroxy-9-methoxy-2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-hexa-2,4-dienoate. Here, we validated this reaction by identifying 5-carboxyvanillate and 4-carboxy-2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate as the products and detd. the kcat and kcat/Km values as 9.3 ± 0.6 s-1 and 2.5 ± 0.2 × 107m-1 s-1, resp. Sequence analyses and a 1.9 Å resoln. crystal structure established that LigY belongs to the amidohydrolase superfamily, unlike previously characterized MCP hydrolases, which are serine-dependent enzymes of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily. The active-site architecture of LigY resembled that of α-amino-β-carboxymuconic-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase, a class III amidohydrolase, with a single zinc ion coordinated by His-6, His-8, His-179, and Glu-282. Interestingly, we found that LigY lacks the acidic residue proposed to activate water for hydrolysis in other class III amidohydrolases. Moreover, substitution of His-223, a conserved residue proposed to activate water in other amidohydrolases, reduced the kcat to a much lesser extent than what has been reported for other amidohydrolases, suggesting that His-223 has a different role in LigY. Substitution of Arg-72, Tyr-190, Arg-234, or Glu-282 reduced LigY activity over 100-fold. On the basis of these results, we propose a catalytic mechanism involving substrate tautomerization, substrate-assisted activation of water for hydrolysis, and formation of a gem-diol intermediate. This last step diverges from what occurs in serine-dependent MCP hydrolases.

To examine LsdA's substrate specificity, we heterologously produced the dimeric enzyme with the help of chaperones. When tested on several substituted stilbenes, LsdA exhibited the greatest specificity for lignostilbene (kcatapp = 1.00 ± 0.04 × 106 M-1 s-1). These expts. further indicated that the substrate's 4-hydroxy moiety is required for catalysis and that this moiety cannot be replaced with a methoxy group. Phenylazophenol inhibited the LsdA-catalyzed cleavage of lignostilbene in a reversible, mixed fashion (Kic = 6 ± 1μ, Kiu = 24 ± 4μM). An X-ray crystal structure of LsdA at 2.3 Å resoln. revealed a seven-bladed β-propeller fold with an iron cofactor coordinated by four histidines, in agreement with previous observations on related carotenoid cleavage oxygenases. We noted that residues at the dimer interface are also present in LsdB, another lignostilbene dioxygenase in S. paucimobilis TMY1009, rationalizing LsdA and LsdB homo- and heterodimerization in vivo. A structure of an LsdA·phenylazophenol complex identified Phe59, Tyr101, and Lys134 as contacting the 4-hydroxyphenyl moiety of the inhibitor. Phe59 and Tyr101 substitutions with His and Phe, resp., reduced LsdA activity (kcatapp) ∼15- and 10-fold. The K134M variant did not detectably cleave lignostilbene, indicating that Lys134 plays a key catalytic role.

Alkylphenols are a key class of depolymerization products whose catabolism is not well-elucidated. We isolated Rhodococcus rhodochrous EP4 on 4-ethylphenol and applied genomic and transcriptomic approaches to elucidate alkylphenol catabolism in EP4 and Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR revealed a pathway encoded by the aphABCDEFGHIQRS genes that degrades 4-ethylphenol via the meta-cleavage of 4-ethylcatechol. This process was initiated by a two-component alkylphenol hydroxylase, encoded by the aphAB genes, which were upregulated ~3,000-fold. Purified AphAB from EP4 had highest specific activity for 4-ethylphenol and 4-propylphenol (~2,000 U/mg) but did not detectably transform phenol. Nevertheless, a ΔaphA mutant in RHA1 grew on 4-ethylphenol by compensatory upregulation of phenol hydroxylase genes (pheA1-3). Deletion of aphC, encoding an extradiol dioxygenase, prevented growth on 4-alkylphenols but not phenol. Disruption of pcaL in the β-ketoadipate pathway prevented growth on phenol but not 4-alkylphenols. Thus, 4-alkylphenols are catabolized exclusively via meta-cleavage in rhodococci while phenol is subject to ortho-cleavage. A putative genomic island encoding aph genes was identified in EP4 and several other rhodococci. Overall, this study identifies a 4-alkylphenol pathway in rhodococci, demonstrates key enzymes involved, and presents evidence that the pathway is encoded in a genomic island. These advances are of particular importance for wide-ranging industrial applications of rhodococci, including upgrading of lignocellulose biomass.[on SciFinder (R)]},

MRSA strains are resistant to a variety of antibiotics, including the classic penicillin and cephalosporin classes of β-lactams, making them intractable to treatment. Although β-lactam resistance in MRSA has been ascribed to the acquisition and activity of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a, encoded by mecA), it has recently been obsd. that resistance can also be mediated by penicillin-binding protein 4 (PBP4). Previously, we have shown that broad-spectrum β-lactam resistance can arise following serial passaging of a mecA-neg. COL strain of S. aureus, creating the CRB strain. This strain has two missense mutations in pbp4 and a mutation in the pbp4 promoter, both of which play an instrumental role in β-lactam resistance. To better understand PBP4's role in resistance, here we have characterized its kinetics and structure with clin. relevant β-lactam antibiotics. We present the first crystallog. PBP4 structures of apo and acyl-enzyme intermediate forms complexed with three late-generation β-lactam antibiotics: ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, and nafcillin. In parallel, we characterized the structural and kinetic effects of the PBP4 mutations present in the CRB strain. Localized within the transpeptidase active-site cleft, the two substitutions appear to have different effects depending on the drug. With ceftobiprole, the missense mutations impaired the Km value 150-fold, decreasing the proportion of inhibited PBP4. However, ceftaroline resistance appeared to be mediated by other factors, possibly including mutation of the pbp4 promoter. Our findings provide evidence that S. aureus CRB has at least two PBP4-mediated resistance mechanisms. [on SciFinder(R)]},

The purified enzyme displayed a blue color typical of laccases, showed strict copper dependence and retained 80% of its activity after 16 h at 70 °C.

KstR is a highly conserved TetR family transcriptional repressor that regulates a large set of genes responsible for cholesterol catabolism. Many genes in this regulon, including kstR, are either induced during infection or are essential for survival of M. tuberculosis in vivo. In this study, we identified two ligands for KstR, both of which are CoA thioester cholesterol metabolites with four intact steroid rings. A metabolite in which one of the rings was cleaved was not a ligand. We confirmed the ligand-protein interactions using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and showed that ligand binding strongly inhibited KstR-DNA binding using surface plasmon resonance (IC50 for ligand = 25 nm). Crystal structures of the ligand-free form of KstR show variability in the position of the DNA-binding domain. In contrast, structures of KstR·ligand complexes are highly similar to each other and demonstrate a position of the DNA-binding domain that is unfavorable for DNA binding. Comparison of ligand-bound and ligand-free structures identifies residues involved in ligand specificity and reveals a distinctive mechanism by which the ligand-induced conformational change mediates DNA release.

Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 catabolizes ferulate via vanillate and the β-ketoadipate pathway. Here, we used transcriptomics to identify genes in RHA1 that are upregulated during growth on ferulate vs. benzoate. The upregulated genes included 3 transcriptional units predicted to encode the uptake and β-oxidative deacetylation of p-hydroxycinnamates: couHTL, couNOM, and couR. Neither ΔcouL mutants nor ΔcouO mutants grew on p-hydroxycinnamates, but they did grow on vanillate. Among several p-hydroxycinnamates, CouL catalyzed the thioesterification of p-coumarate and caffeate most efficiently (kcat/Km = ∼400mM-1 s-1). P-Coumarate was also RHA1's preferred growth substrate, suggesting that CouL is a determinant of the pathway's specificity. CouL did not catalyze the activation of sinapate, in similarity to 2 p-coumaric acid:CoA ligases from plants, and contains the same bulged loop that helps det. substrate specificity in the plant homologs. The couO mutant accumulated 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-β-ketopropionate in the culture supernatant when incubated with ferulate, supporting β-oxidative deacetylation. This phenotype was not complemented with a D257N variant of CouO, consistent with the predicted role of Asp257 as a metal ligand in this amidohydrolase superfamily member. These data suggest that CouO functionally replaces the β-ketothiolase and acyl-CoA thioesterase that occur in canonical β-oxidative pathways. Finally, the transcriptomics data suggest the involvement of 2 distinct formaldehyde detoxification pathways in vanillate catabolism and identify a eugenol catabolic pathway.

The crystal structures of ligand-free CouR and its p-coumaroyl-CoA-bound form showed no significant conformational differences, in contrast to other MarR regulators. The CouR-p-coumaroyl-CoA structure revealed two ligand mols. bound to the CouR dimer with their phenolic moieties occupying equiv. hydrophobic pockets in each protomer and their CoA moieties adopting non-equiv. positions to mask the regulator's predicted DNA-binding surface. More specifically, the CoA phosphates formed salt bridges with predicted DNA-binding residues Arg36 and Arg38, changing the overall charge of the DNA-binding surface. The substitution of either arginine with alanine completely abrogated the ability of CouR to bind DNA. By contrast, the R36A/R38A double variant retained a relatively high affinity for p-coumaroyl-CoA (Kd = 89 ± 6 μM). Together, our data point to a novel mechanism of action in which the ligand abrogates the repressor's ability to bind DNA by steric occlusion of key DNA-binding residues and charge repulsion of the DNA backbone.

Consistent with its role in bile acid catabolism, KshA1 from Rhodococcus rhodochrous DSM43269 had the highest apparent specificity (kcat/Km) for steroids with an iso-Pr side chain at C17, such as 3-oxo-23,24-bisnorcholesta-1,4-diene-22-oate (1,4-BNC). By contrast, the KshA5 homolog had the highest apparent specificity for substrates with no C17 side chain (kcat/Km >105 s-1m-1 for 4-estrendione, 5α-androstandione, and testosterone). Unexpectedly, substrates such as 4-androstene-3,17-dione (ADD) and 4-BNC displayed strong substrate inhibition (KiS ∼100 μm). By comparison, the cholesterol-degrading KshAMtb from Mycobacterium tuberculosis had the highest specificity for CoA-thioesterified substrates. These specificities are consistent with differences in the catabolism of cholesterol and bile acids, resp., in actinobacteria. X-ray crystallog. structures of the KshAMtb·ADD, KshA1·1,4-BNC-CoA, KshA5·ADD, and KshA5·1,4-BNC-CoA complexes revealed that the enzymes have very similar steroid-binding pockets with the substrate's C17 oriented toward the active site opening. Comparisons suggest Tyr-245 and Phe-297 are determinants of KshA1 specificity. All enzymes have a flexible 16-residue "mouth loop," which in some structures completely occluded the substrate-binding pocket from the bulk solvent. Remarkably, the catalytic iron and α-helixes harboring its ligands were displaced up to 4.4 Å in the KshA5·substrate complexes as compared with substrate-free KshA, suggesting that Rieske oxygenases may have a dynamic nature similar to cytochrome P 450.

  abstract = {Laccases are abundant in microorganisms specialized in lignocellulose degrdn., but the exact role of the enzymes in this process remains poorly understood. Laccases catalyze oxidn. of lignin, initially producing a phenoxy radical. The heterogeneous lignin structure can stabilize these reactive radicals, but eventually, they dissipate by uncharacterized mechanisms. We show that the laccase-catalyzed oxidn. of lignin leads to formation of H2O2, likely via a reaction between lignin radicals and O2. Up to 25μM of H2O2 was generated by each of four fungal and bacterial laccases catalyzing oxidn. of both organosolv lignin and birch wood. The generated H2O2 activated lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) both in sep. reactions, where the LPMOs were fed with laccase-generated H2O2, and in one-pot reactions, where laccases and LPMOs acted simultaneously. These observations are new, and our results reveal a potentially crit. connection between conversion of lignin and polysaccharides, suggesting that laccases generate H2O2 for other lignocellulose-depolymg. enzymes such as lignin peroxidases and LPMOs. This new role for laccases may be exploited in application settings. Laccase oxidn. of lignin induces the formation of H2O2 in an amt. sufficient to fuel a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase reaction and may explain the biol. role of laccase during lignocellulose degrdn.

These WEs were fully satd. and contained primarily 31 to 34 carbon atoms. Moreover, they were present at higher levels during exponential growth than under lipid-accumulating conditions.

The purified enzyme catalyzed the NADPH-dependent transformation of stearoyl-CoA to stearyl alc. with a specific activity of 45 ± 3 nmol/mg · min and dodecanal to dodecanol with a specific activity of 5,300 ± 300 nmol/mg · min. Deletion of fcrA did not affect WE accumulation when grown in either carbon- or nitrogen-limited medium. However, the ΔfcrA mutant accumulated less than 20% of the amt. of WEs as the wild-type strain under conditions of nitric oxide stress. A strain of RHA1 overproducing FcrA accumulated WEs to ∼13% cellular dry wt. under lipid-accumulating conditions, and their acyl moieties had longer av. chain lengths than those in wild-type cells (C17 vs. C16).

Herein, we rewired lipid accumulation in Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 to create an industrially viable biocatalyst for the prodn. of high-value wax esters (WEs). To efficiently manipulate these non-model bacteria, we first expanded the genetic tools available in rhodococci, creating pSYN, an integrative, modular expression vector. We employed this vector to screen predicted promoters, creating a library of strong constitutive promoters. RHA1 strains with a chromosomal insertion of fcrA, encoding a fatty acyl-CoA reductase, under the control of constitutive promoters accumulated WEs. We next screened wax synthases, identifying WS2 of Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus DSM 8798 as the most effective at increasing WE levels in RHA1. Cassettes for the coexpression of chromosomally integrated fcrA and ws2 were created and transformed into RHA1, yielding a biocatalyst that, when grown in flasks, accumulated WEs to greater than 15% CDW, at yields of 0.05 g per g glucose, while maintaining 80% of the specific growth rate of WT. The accumulated WEs were 29 to 38 carbon atoms in length, of which 75% were unsatd., with a ∼2 : 1 mix of mono- and diunsatd. species. In fed-batch fermns., the biocatalyst produced WEs with a titer, rate, and yield of approx. 5 g L-1, 1 g L-1 day-1, and 0.025 g per g glucose, resp.

DxnB2 is a HOPDA hydrolase that catalyzes the C-C bond hydrolysis of the biphenyl metabolite, 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA). The hydrolysis of HOPDA has been proposed to proceed via an enol-to-keto tautomerization followed by a nucleophilic mechanism of catalysis. Ketonization involves an intermediate, ESred, which possesses a marked bathochromically shifted absorption spectrum. Here, the authors investigated the catalytic mechanism of MCP hydrolases using HOPDA hydrolase DxnB2 of Sphingomonas wittichii RW1. Pre-steady-state kinetic and LC ESI/MS evaluation of the DxnB2-mediated hydrolysis of HOPDA to 2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoic acid and benzoate supported a nucleophilic mechanism catalysis. In DxnB2, the rate of ESred decay and product formation showed a solvent kinetic isotope effect of 2.5, indicating that a proton transfer reaction, assigned here to substrate ketonization, limited the rate of acylation. For a series of substituted MCPs, this rate was linearly dependent on the MCP pKa2 value (βnuc = ∼1). Structural characterization of DxnB2 S105A:MCP complexes revealed that the catalytic His residue was displaced upon substrate-binding. The results provided evidence for enzyme-catalyzed ketonization in which the catalytic His-Asp pair does not play an essential role. The data further suggested that ESred represents a dianionic intermediate that acts as a general base to activate the Ser nucleophile. Thus, this substrate-assisted mechanism of nucleophilic catalysis distinguishes MCP hydrolases from other serine hydrolases. [on SciFinder(R)]},

By contrast, DxnB2 from Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of 3-Cl HOPDAs more efficiently. X-ray crystallog. studies of the catalytically inactive S105A variant of DxnB2 complexed with tri-Cl HOPDA revealed a binding mode in which C1 through C6 of the dienoate are coplanar. The chlorine substituent is accommodated by a hydrophobic pocket that is larger than the homologous site in BphDLB400 from Burkholderia xenovorans LB400. The planar binding mode obsd. in the cryst. complex was consistent with the hyper- and hypsochromically shifted absorption spectra of 3-Cl and 3,9,11-triCl HOPDA, resp., bound to S105A in soln. Moreover, ESred, an intermediate possessing a bathochromically shifted spectrum obsd. in the turnover of HOPDA, was not detected, suggesting that substrate destabilization was rate-limiting in the turnover of these PCB metabolites. Interestingly, electron d. for the first α-helix of the lid domain was poorly defined in the dimeric DxnB2 structures, unlike in the tetrameric BphDLB400. Structural comparison of MCP hydrolases identified the NC-loop, connecting the lid to the α/β-hydrolase core domain, as a determinant in the oligomeric state and suggests its involvement in catalysis. Finally, an increased mobility of the DxnB2 lid may contribute to the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze PCB metabolites, highlighting how lid architecture contributes to substrate specificity in α/β-hydrolases.

In addn., sLac treatment reduced the molar mass of the APPL by over 50%, as detd. by gel-permeation chromatog. coupled with multi-angle light scattering.

Iron redn. by lignin surfaces permits the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the cell wall to help explain fungal non-enzymic cell wall deconstruction, and it also provides an explanation for certain phenomenon such as the anthropogenic generation of formaldehyde by wood. The mechanism also provides a basis for the generation of electrons by lignin that are required by certain fungal redox enzymes active in plant cell wall degrading systems.

Based on this observation, we developed a chem.-rescue strategy to identify compds. that target metabolic enzymes involved in cholesterol metab. This approach identified two compds. that inhibit the HsaAB enzyme complex, which is required for complete degrdn. of the cholesterol A/B rings. The strategy also identified an inhibitor of PrpC, the 2-methylcitrate synthase, which is required for assimilation of cholesterol-derived propionyl-CoA into the TCA cycle. These chem. probes represent new classes of inhibitors with novel modes of action, and target metabolic pathways required to support growth of Mtb in its host cell. The screen also revealed a structurally-diverse set of compds. that target addnl. stage(s) of cholesterol utilization. Mutants resistant to this class of compds. are defective in the bacterial adenylate cyclase Rv1625/Cya. These data implicate cyclic-AMP (cAMP) in regulating cholesterol utilization in Mtb, and are consistent with published reports indicating that propionate metab. is regulated by cAMP levels. Intriguingly, reversal of the cholesterol-dependent growth inhibition caused by this subset of compds. could be achieved by supplementing the media with acetate, but not with glucose, indicating that Mtb is subject to a unique form of metabolic constraint induced by the presence of cholesterol.

The extant diversity of lignin-degrading bacteria and fungi is underestimated by culture-dependent methods, limiting our understanding of the functional and ecol. traits of decomposers populations. Here, we describe the use of stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled with amplicon and shotgun metagenomics to identify and characterize the functional attributes of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading fungi and bacteria in coniferous forest soils from across North America. We tested the extent to which catabolic genes partitioned among different decomposer taxa; the relative roles of bacteria and fungi, and whether taxa or catabolic genes correlated with variation in lignocellulolytic activity, measured as the total assimilation of 13C-label into DNA and phospholipid fatty acids. We found high overall bacterial degrdn. of our model lignin substrate, particularly by gram-neg. bacteria (Comamonadaceae and Caulobacteraceae), while fungi were more prominent in cellulose-degrdn. Very few taxa incorporated 13C-label from more than one lignocellulosic polymer, suggesting specialization among decomposers. Collectively, members of Caulobacteraceae could degrade all three lignocellulosic polymers, providing new evidence for their importance in lignocellulose degrdn. Variation in lignin-degrading activity was better explained by microbial community properties, such as catabolic gene content and community structure, than cellulose-degrading activity. SIP significantly improved shotgun metagenome assembly resulting in the recovery of several high-quality draft metagenome-assembled genomes and over 7500 contigs contg. unique clusters of carbohydrate-active genes.

  abstract = {Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) is a widely used explosive and a major soil and groundwater contaminant. Organisms such as Gordonia sp. KTR9, capable of degrading RDX and using it as an N source, may prove useful for bioremediation of contaminated sites. XplA is a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase responsible for RDX degrdn. Expression of xplA in KTR9 was not induced by RDX but was strongly induced (50-fold) during N-limited growth. When glnR, encoding a regulatory protein affecting N assimilation in diverse Actinobacteria, was deleted from KTR9, the bacterium lost the ability to use nitrate, nitrite, and RDX as N sources. Deletion of glnR also abolished the inhibition of xplA expression by nitrite. Our results confirm the essential role of GlnR in regulating assimilation of nitrite, but there was no evidence for a direct role of GlnR in regulating XplA expression. Rather, the general availability of nitrogen repressed XplA expression. We conclude that the inability of the glnR mutant to use RDX as an N source was due to its inability to assimilate nitrite, an intermediate in the assimilation of nitrogen from RDX. Regulation of XplA does not seem adaptive for KTR9, but it is important for RDX bioremediation with KTR9 or similar bacteria. [on SciFinder(R)]},
