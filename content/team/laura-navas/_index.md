Lignin is the most abundant aromatic biopolymer in the biosphere and its sustainable valorization is essential to the success of next generation biorefineries. Lauraâ€™s research aims to elucidate bacterial activities that transform lignin components from different feedstocks and develop biocatalysts to upgrade lignin converting it into commodity chemicals.
