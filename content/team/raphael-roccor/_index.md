Our world still relies heavily on unsustainable resources and practices. Lipid-based chemicals, for example, ubiquitously used in foods, fuels, and consumer products, are predominantly derived from palm oil and petroleum. The production of these oleochemicals has significant environmental impacts; and as global demand for the products containing these chemicals rise, so will the associated environmental burden. Therefore, my research focuses on using microbial biocatalyst to create sustainable bioproducts.
