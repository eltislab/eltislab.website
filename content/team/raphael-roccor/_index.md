Our world still relies heavily on unsustainable resources and practices. Lipid-based chemicals, for example, ubiquitously used in foods, fuels, and consumer products, are predominantly derived from palm oil and petroleum. The production of these oleochemicals has significant environmental impacts; and as global demand for the products containing these chemicals rise, so will the associated environmental burden. My PhD project aims to develop innovative technologies to produce sustainable chemicals from crop or forestry residues, thereby replacing those derived from petroleum or palm oil. More specifically, I am developing a microbial platform technology to convert sugars and aromatic residues that can be derived from biomass waste streams into a class of high-value oleochemicals called wax esters. Due to their excellent lubricating and emollient properties, wax esters are widely used in the personal care and chemical lubrication industry.
