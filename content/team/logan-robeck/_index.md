Hello!

I am a Canadian-born American, and started as a PhD student in the Eltis Lab in 2020. Broadly, my interests include understanding and improving how microbes metabolize carbon with the aim of re-purposing this capacity towards the development of the "Circular Bioeconomy".

Outside of the lab my hobbies general focus around outdoor sports, especially rock climbing!
