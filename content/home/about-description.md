Bacteria possess an astounding armamentarium of catabolic activities. These activities drive important ecological processes, have tremendous biotechnological potential and, in the case of pathogens, ensure survival under host-imposed constraints. The overall objective of research in the Eltis Lab is to characterize key pathways and enzymes involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds and steroids in *Mycobacterium* and *Rhodococcus*. Specific objectives are to: elucidate the catalytic mechanism of enzymes, understand how mycobacteria and rhodococci coordinate the concurrent catabolism of multiple substrates to maximize growth, and harness this knowledge to create useful biocatalysts. 

* Research on the catabolism of aromatic compounds focuses on activities that transform lignin-derived compounds. 
* Research on steroid catabolism focuses on activities essential to the pathogenesis of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. 
* Research on biocatalysts focuses on harnessing the catabolic and oleaginous abilities of *Rhodococcus*. 

Outcomes of the research include biocatalysts to valorize lignocellulosic biomass and create sustainable biomaterials, as well as urgently needed therapeutics to treat TB.
