Microbial catabolic activities underpin life on our planet, helping to maintaining the health of ecosystems ranging from ocean and forest environments to the different parts of the human body. By studying these enzymes and pathways, we can understand: How they can be harnessed as biocatalysts, to increase sustainability in the agricultural, food, textile, pharmaceutical and chemical industries; as well as, the roles these enzymes play in pathogens, providing potential targets for novel therapeutics, which are urgently needed in this era of increasing antibiotic resistance.
