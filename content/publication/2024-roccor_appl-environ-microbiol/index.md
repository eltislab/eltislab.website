abstract: "Ethylene glycol (EG) is a widely used industrial chemical with
  manifold applications and also generated in the degradation of plastics such
  as polyethylene terephthalate. *Rhodococcus jostii* RHA1 (RHA1), a potential
  biocatalytic chassis, grows on EG. Transcriptomic analyses revealed four
  clusters of genes potentially involved in EG catabolism: the *mad* locus,
  predicted to encode mycofactocin-dependent alcohol degradation, including the
  catabolism of EG to glycolate; two GCL clusters, predicted to encode glycolate
  and glyoxylate catabolism; and the *mft* genes, predicted to specify
  mycofactocin biosynthesis. Bioinformatic analyses further revealed that
  the *mad* and *mft* genes are widely distributed in mycolic acid-producing
  bacteria such as RHA1. Neither Δ*madA* nor Δ*mftC* RHA1 mutant strains grew on
  EG but grew on acetate. In resting cell assays, the Δ*madA* mutant depleted
  glycolaldehyde but not EG from culture media. These results indicate
  that *madA* encodes a mycofactocin-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase that
  initiates EG catabolism. In contrast to some mycobacterial strains,
  the *mad* genes did not appear to enable RHA1 to grow on methanol as sole
  substrate. Finally, a strain of RHA1 adapted to grow ~3× faster on EG
  contained an overexpressed gene, *aldA2*, predicted to encode an aldehyde
  dehydrogenase. When incubated with EG, this strain accumulated lower
  concentrations of glycolaldehyde than RHA1. Moreover, ecotopically
  expressed *aldA2* increased RHA1’s tolerance for EG further suggesting that
  glycolaldehyde accumulation limits growth of RHA1 on EG. Overall, this study
  provides insights into the bacterial catabolism of small alcohols and
  aldehydes and facilitates the engineering of *Rhodococcus* for the upgrading
  of plastic waste streams."
