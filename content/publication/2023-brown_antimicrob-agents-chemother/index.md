abstract: Despite the deployment of combination tuberculosis (TB) chemotherapy,
  efforts to identify shorter, nonrelapsing treatments have resulted in limited
  success. Recent evidence indicates that GSK2556286 (GSK286), which acts via
  Rv1625c, a membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*,
  shortens treatment in rodents relative to standard of care drugs. Moreover,
  GSK286 can replace linezolid in the three-drug, Nix-TB regimen. Given its
  therapeutic potential, we sought to better understand the mechanism of action
  of GSK286. The compound blocked growth of *M. tuberculosis* in cholesterol
  media and increased intracellular cAMP levels ~50-fold. GSK286 did not inhibit
  growth of an *rv1625c* transposon mutant in cholesterol media and did not
  induce cyclic AMP (cAMP) production in this mutant, suggesting that the
  compound acts on this adenylyl cyclase. GSK286 also induced cAMP production in
  *Rhodococcus jostii* RHA1, a cholesterol-catabolizing actinobacterium, when
  Rv1625c was heterologously expressed. However, these elevated levels of cAMP
  did not inhibit growth of *R. jostii* RHA1 in cholesterol medium. Mutations in
  *rv1625c* conferred cross-resistance to GSK286 and the known Rv1625c agonist,
  mCLB073. Metabolic profiling of *M. tuberculosis* cells revealed that elevated
  cAMP levels, induced using either an agonist or a genetic tool, did not
  significantly affect pools of steroid metabolites in cholesterol-incubated
  cells. Finally, the inhibitory effect of agonists was not dependent on the
  *N*-acetyltransferase MtPat. Together, these data establish that GSK286 is an
  Rv1625c agonist and sheds light on how cAMP signaling can be manipulated as a
  novel antibiotic strategy to shorten TB treatments. Nevertheless, the detailed
  mechanism of action of these compounds remains to be elucidated.
