 abstract = {Many rhodococci are oleaginous and, as such, have considerable potential for the sustainable prodn. of lipid-based commodity chems. Herein, we demonstrated that Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, a soil bacterium that catabolizes a wide range of org. compds., produced wax esters (WEs) up to 0.0002% of its cellular dry wt. during exponential growth on glucose. These WEs were fully satd. and contained primarily 31 to 34 carbon atoms. Moreover, they were present at higher levels during exponential growth than under lipid-accumulating conditions. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that RHA1 contains a gene encoding a putative fatty acyl CoA (acyl-CoA) reductase (FcrA). The purified enzyme catalyzed the NADPH-dependent transformation of stearoyl-CoA to stearyl alc. with a specific activity of 45 ± 3 nmol/mg · min and dodecanal to dodecanol with a specific activity of 5,300 ± 300 nmol/mg · min. Deletion of fcrA did not affect WE accumulation when grown in either carbon- or nitrogen-limited medium. However, the ΔfcrA mutant accumulated less than 20% of the amt. of WEs as the wild-type strain under conditions of nitric oxide stress. A strain of RHA1 overproducing FcrA accumulated WEs to ∼13% cellular dry wt. under lipid-accumulating conditions, and their acyl moieties had longer av. chain lengths than those in wild-type cells (C17 vs. C16). The results provide insight into the biosynthesis of WEs in rhodococci and facilitate the development of this genus for the prodn. of highvalue neutral lipids. [on SciFinder(R)]},
