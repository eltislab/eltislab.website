 abstract = {A series of alkylated 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyls were prepd. on the gram-scale by using an effective directed ortho metalation-Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling strategy. Compds. were investigated the substrate specificity of the meta-cleavage dioxygenase BphC, a key enzyme in the microbial catabolism of biphenyl. Isolation and characterization of the meta-cleavage products were allowed for further study of related processes, including the catabolism of lignin-derived biphenyls. [on SciFinder(R)]},
