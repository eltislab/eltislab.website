abstract: Emergent strategies to valorize lignin, an abundant but underutilized
  aromatic biopolymer, include tandem processes that integrate chemical
  depolymerization and biological catalysis. To date, aromatic monomers from C–O
  bond cleavage of lignin have been converted to bioproducts, but the presence
  of recalcitrant C–C bonds in lignin limits the product yield. A promising
  chemocatalytic strategy that overcomes this limitation involves phenol methyl
  protection and autoxidation. Incorporating this into a tandem process requires
  microbial cell factories able to transform the *p*-methoxylated products in
  the resulting methylated lignin stream. In this study, we assessed the ability
  of *Rhodococcus jostii* RHA1 to catabolize the major aromatic products in a
  methylated lignin stream and elucidated the pathways responsible for this
  catabolism. RHA1 grew on a methylated pine lignin stream, catabolizing the
  major aromatic monomers: *p*-methoxybenzoate (*p*-MBA), veratrate, and
  veratraldehyde. Bioinformatic analyses suggested that a cytochrome P450, PbdA,
  and its cognate reductase, PbdB, are involved in *p*-MBA catabolism. Gene
  deletion studies established that both *pbdA* and *pbdB* are essential for
  growth on *p*-MBA and several derivatives. Furthermore, a deletion mutant of a
  candidate *p-*hydroxybenzoate (*p*-HBA) hydroxylase, Δ*pobA*, did not grow
  on *p*-HBA. Veratraldehyde and veratrate catabolism required both vanillin
  dehydrogenase (Vdh) and vanillate *O*-demethylase (VanAB), revealing
  previously unknown roles of these enzymes. Finally, a Δ*pcaL* strain grew on
  neither *p*-MBA nor veratrate, indicating they are catabolized through the
  β-ketoadipate pathway. This study expands our understanding of the bacterial
  catabolism of aromatic compounds and facilitates the development of
  biocatalysts for lignin valorization.
