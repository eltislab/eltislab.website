abstract: Lignin is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels as a feedstock for
  the sustainable manufacture of chemicals. Emergent strategies for lignin
  valorization include tandem processes whereby thermochemical fractionation of
  the biomass yields a mixture of lignin-derived aromatic compounds (LDACs),
  which are then transformed into target compounds by a microbial cell factory.
  Identifying LDAC-degrading pathways is critical to optimize carbon yield from
  diverse depolymerization mixtures. Characterizing enzymes – especially those
  that catalyze the rate-limiting steps of *O*-demethylation, hydroxylation, and
  decarboxylation – informs and enables biocatalyst design. Rational,
  structure-based engineering of key enzymes, as well as untargeted,
  evolution-based approaches, further optimize biocatalysis. In this review we
  outline recent advances in these fields which are critical in developing
  biocatalysts to efficiently synthesize lignin-based bioproducts.
