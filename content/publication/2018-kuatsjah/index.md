abstract: "LigY catalyzes the hydrolysis of a meta-cleavage product (MCP), 4,11-dicarboxy-8-hydroxy-9-methoxy-2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate (DCHM-HOPDA), in the bacterial catabolism of lignin-derived biphenyl. Most characterized MCP hydrolases are serine-dependent, with hydrolysis proceeding via enol-keto tautomerization followed by an acyl-enzyme intermediate. In contrast, LigY is Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, with hydrolysis proposed to proceed via tautomerization followed by formation of a gem-diol intermediate. Transient-state kinetic analysis of DCHM-HOPDA turnover revealed the formation of an intermediate possessing a bathochromically shifted spectrum (λ<sub>max</sub> = 508 nm), similar to that of the ES<sup>red</sup> intermediate observed during tautomerization in serine-dependent hydrolases. Neither the formation (1/τ<sub>1</sub> ≈ 137 s<sup>-1</sup>) nor the decay (1/τ<sub>2</sub> ≈ 23 s<sup>-1</sup>) of ES<sup>red</sup> was rate-limiting (*k*<sub>cat</sub> = 9.7 ± 0.3 s<sup>-1</sup>). Furthermore, the rate of ES<sup>red</sup> decay was 3.4-fold slower in deuterated buffer, suggesting a proton-transfer reaction consistent with substrate ketonization. LigY turned over 4-carboxy-HOPDA but not 4-methyl-HOPDA, suggesting that the carboxylate is essential for catalysis. Titration of LigY with 4-methyl-HOPDA yielded a species with a spectrum similar to that of ES<sup>red</sup> (*K*<sub>d</sub> = 25 ± 1 μM). A 2.4-Å crystal structure of the LigY·4-methyl-HOPDA complex, which also had a spectrum like ES<sup>red</sup>, revealed the ligand coordinated to the Zn<sup>2+</sup> in a bidentate manner via the 1-carboxylate and 2-oxo groups. Overall, the data support a mechanism in which the metallocenter primarily catalyzes substrate tautomerization and the water required for the hydrolytic half-reaction is activated in a substrate-assisted manner. This study provides insight into C-C bond hydrolases as well as the versatility of the catalytic machinery of metallohydrolases. [on SciFinder(R)]"
