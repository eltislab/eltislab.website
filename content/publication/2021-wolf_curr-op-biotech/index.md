abstract: The valorization of lignin is critical to establishing sustainable
  biorefineries as we transition away from petroleum-derived feedstocks.
  Advances in lignin fractionation and depolymerization are yielding new
  opportunities for the biocatalytic upgrading of lignin-derived aromatic
  compounds (LDACs) using microbial cell factories. Given their roles in lignin
  metabolism and their catalytic versatility, cytochromes P450 are attractive
  enzymes in engineering such biocatalysts. Here we highlight P450s that
  catalyze aromatic O-demethylation, a rate-limiting step in the conversion of
  LDACs to valuable chemicals, including efforts to engineer the specificity of
  these enzymes and to use them in developing biocatalysts. We also discuss
  broader opportunities at the intersection of biochemistry, structure-guided
  enzyme engineering, and metabolic engineering for application of P450s in the
  emerging area of microbial lignin valorization.
