abstract: The prodigious ability of bacteria to catabolize aromatic compounds
  has sparked considerable efforts to engineer bacteria to valorize lignin, an
  under-utilized component of biomass. Despite decades of study, key catabolic
  pathways and enzymes remain poorly characterized. We recently identified the
  hydroxyphenylethanone (Hpe) pathway, which enables *Rhodococcus
  rhodochrous* GD02 and other bacteria to catabolize 4-hydroxyacetophenone (HAP)
  and acetovanillone (AV), which are generated in the catalytic fractionation of
  lignin. Catabolism is initiated by a two-component, ATP-dependent dikinase,
  HpeHI, homologs of which are involved in the catabolism of other aromatic
  compounds. In biochemical studies, the kinase activity of HpeHI was highest at
  low ionic strength and low concentrations of Mn2+. HpeHI had highest apparent
  specificity for HAP and AV (*k*cat/*K*M ≥ 250 mM-1 s-1) and had
  submicromolar *K*M values for these substrates, consistent with the enzyme
  acting as a scavenging system. The enzyme also transformed
  4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, acetosyringone, and phenol. A 1.8 Å crystal
  structure of HpeI revealed that it is homologous to the ATP-grasp domain of
  rifampin phosphotransferase (RPH) while an AlphaFold model of HpeH indicated
  that it is homologous to the swivel and rifampin-binding domains of RPH.
  Consistent with HpeHI using a similar mechanism where the swivel domain
  transits between the spatially distinct substrate-binding sites, substitution
  of the conserved His residue in HpeH abolished kinase activity. Moreover, the
  HpeH component alone catalyzed phosphotransfer from 4-phosphoacetophenone to
  AV. This study reveals a subfamily of small molecule dikinases that comprise
  two components, some of which are involved in aromatic compound catabolism.
