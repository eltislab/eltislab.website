abstract: Oxygenases catalyze crucial reactions throughout all domains of life,
  cleaving molecular oxygen (O2) and inserting one or two of its atoms into
  organic substrates. Many oxygenases, including those in the cytochrome P450
  (P450) and Rieske oxygenase enzyme families, function as multicomponent
  systems, which require one or more redox partners to transfer electrons to the
  catalytic center. As the identity of the reductase can change the reactivity
  of the oxygenase, characterization of the latter with its cognate redox
  partners is critical. However, the isolation of the native redox partner or
  partners is often challenging. Here, we report the preparation and
  characterization of PbdB, the native reductase partner of PbdA, a bacterial
  P450 enzyme that catalyzes the *O*-demethylation of *para*-methoxylated
  benzoates. Through production in a rhodoccocal host, codon optimization, and
  anaerobic purification, this procedure overcomes conventional challenges in
  redox partner production and allows for robust oxygenase characterization with
  its native redox partner. Key lessons learned here, including the value of
  production in a related host and rare codon effects are applicable to a broad
  range of Fe-dependent oxygenases and their components.
