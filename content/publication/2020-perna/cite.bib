 abstract = {Laccases are abundant in microorganisms specialized in lignocellulose degrdn., but the exact role of the enzymes in this process remains poorly understood. Laccases catalyze oxidn. of lignin, initially producing a phenoxy radical. The heterogeneous lignin structure can stabilize these reactive radicals, but eventually, they dissipate by uncharacterized mechanisms. We show that the laccase-catalyzed oxidn. of lignin leads to formation of H2O2, likely via a reaction between lignin radicals and O2. Up to 25μM of H2O2 was generated by each of four fungal and bacterial laccases catalyzing oxidn. of both organosolv lignin and birch wood. The generated H2O2 activated lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) both in sep. reactions, where the LPMOs were fed with laccase-generated H2O2, and in one-pot reactions, where laccases and LPMOs acted simultaneously. These observations are new, and our results reveal a potentially crit. connection between conversion of lignin and polysaccharides, suggesting that laccases generate H2O2 for other lignocellulose-depolymg. enzymes such as lignin peroxidases and LPMOs. This new role for laccases may be exploited in application settings. Laccase oxidn. of lignin induces the formation of H2O2 in an amt. sufficient to fuel a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase reaction and may explain the biol. role of laccase during lignocellulose degrdn.
