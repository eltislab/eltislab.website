abstract: Bacterial catabolic pathways have considerable potential as industrial
  biocatalysts for the valorization of lignin, a major component of
  plant-derived biomass. Here, we describe a pathway responsible for the
  catabolism of acetovanillone, a major component of several industrial lignin
  streams. *Rhodococcus rhodochrous* GD02 was previously isolated for growth on
  acetovanillone. A high-quality genome sequence of GD02 was generated.
  Transcriptomic analyses revealed a cluster of eight genes up-regulated during
  growth on acetovanillone and 4-hydroxyacetophenone, as well as a two-gene
  cluster up-regulated during growth on acetophenone. Bioinformatic analyses
  predicted that the hydroxyphenylethanone (Hpe) pathway proceeds via
  phosphorylation and carboxylation, before β-elimination yields vanillate from
  acetovanillone or 4-hydroxybenzoate from 4-hydroxyacetophenone. Consistent
  with this prediction, the kinase, HpeHI, phosphorylated acetovanillone and
  4-hydroxyacetophenone. Furthermore, HpeCBA, a biotin-dependent enzyme,
  catalyzed the ATP-dependent carboxylation of 4-phospho-acetovanillone but not
  acetovanillone. The carboxylase’s specificity for 4-phospho-acetophenone
  (*k*cat/*K*M = 34 ± 2 mM−1 s−1) was approximately an order of magnitude higher
  than for 4-phospho-acetovanillone. HpeD catalyzed the efficient
  dephosphorylation of the carboxylated products. GD02 grew on a preparation of
  pine lignin produced by oxidative catalytic fractionation, depleting all of
  the acetovanillone, vanillin, and vanillate. Genomic and metagenomic searches
  indicated that the Hpe pathway occurs in a relatively small number of
  bacteria. This study facilitates the design of bacterial strains for
  biocatalytic applications by identifying a pathway for the degradation of
  acetovanillone.
