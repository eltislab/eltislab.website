abstract: "The actinobacterium *Rhodococcus jostii* RHA1 grows on a remarkable
  variety of aromatic compounds and has been studied for applications ranging
  from the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls to the valorization of
  lignin, an underutilized component of biomass. In RHA1, the catabolism of two
  classes of lignin-derived compounds, alkylphenols and alkylguaiacols, involves
  a phylogenetically distinct extradiol dioxygenase, AphC, previously
  misannotated as BphC, an enzyme involved in biphenyl catabolism. To better
  understand the role of AphC in RHA1 catabolism, we first showed that purified
  AphC had highest apparent specificity for 4-propylcatechol
  (*k*cat/*K*M ∼106 M−1 s−1), and its apparent specificity for 4-alkylated
  substrates followed the trend for alkylguaiacols: propyl > ethyl > methyl >
  phenyl > unsubstituted. We also show AphC only poorly cleaved
  3-phenylcatechol, the preferred substrate of BphC. Moreover, AphC and BphC
  cleaved 3-phenylcatechol and 4-phenylcatechol with different
  regiospecificities, likely due to the substrates’ binding mode. A
  crystallographic structure of the AphC·4-ethylcatechol binary complex to
  1.59 Å resolution revealed that the catechol is bound to the active site iron
  in a bidentate manner and that the substrate’s alkyl side chain is
  accommodated by a hydrophobic pocket. Finally, we show RHA1 grows on a mixture
  of 4-ethylguaiacol and guaiacol, simultaneously catabolizing these substrates
  through *meta-*cleavage and *ortho-*cleavage pathways, respectively,
  suggesting that the specificity of AphC helps to prevent the routing of
  catechol through the Aph pathway. Overall, this study contributes to our
  understanding of the bacterial catabolism of aromatic compounds derived from
  lignin, and the determinants of specificity in extradiol dioxygenases."
