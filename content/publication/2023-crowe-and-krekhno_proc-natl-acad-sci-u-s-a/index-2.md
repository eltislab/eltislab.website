abstract: "*Mycobacterium abscessus*, an opportunistic pathogen responsible for
  pulmonary infections, contains genes predicted to encode two steroid catabolic
  pathways: a cholesterol catabolic pathway similar to that of *Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis* and a 4-androstenedione (4-AD) catabolic pathway. Consistent
  with this prediction, *M. abscessus* grew on both steroids. In contrast to *M.
  tuberculosis*, *Rhodococcus jostii* RHA1, and other Actinobacteria, the
  cholesterol and 4-AD catabolic gene clusters of the *M. abscessus* complex
  lack genes encoding HsaD, the *meta*-cleavage product (MCP) hydrolase.
  However, *M. abscessus* ATCC 19977 harbors two *hsaD*homologs elsewhere in its
  genome. Only one of the encoded enzymes detectably transformed steroid
  metabolites. Among tested substrates, HsaDMab and HsaDMtb of *M.
  tuberculosis* had highest substrate specificities for MCPs with partially
  degraded side chains thioesterified with coenzyme A (*k*cat/*K*M = 1.9 ×
  104 and 5.7 × 103 mM-1s-1, respectively). Consistent with a dual role in
  cholesterol and 4-AD catabolism, HsaDMab also transformed nonthioesterified
  substrates efficiently, and a Δ*hsaD* mutant of *M. abscessus* grew on neither
  steroid. Interestingly, both steroids prevented growth of the mutant on
  acetate. The Δ*hsaD* mutant of *M. abscessus* excreted cholesterol metabolites
  with a fully degraded side chain, while the corresponding RHA1 mutant excreted
  metabolites with partially degraded side chains. Finally, the Δ*hsaD* mutant
  was not viable in macrophages. Overall, our data establish that the
  cholesterol and 4-AD catabolic pathways of *M. abscessus* are unique in that
  they converge upstream of where this occurs in characterized
  steroid-catabolizing bacteria. The data further indicate that cholesterol is a
  substrate for intracellular bacteria and that cholesterol-dependent toxicity
  is not strictly dependent on coenzyme A sequestration."
