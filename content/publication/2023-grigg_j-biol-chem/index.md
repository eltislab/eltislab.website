abstract: "*Mycobacterium tuberculosis's* (Mtb) success as a pathogen is due in
  part to its sophisticated lipid metabolic programs, both catabolic and
  biosynthetic. Several of Mtb lipids have specific roles in pathogenesis, but
  the identity and roles of many are unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the tyz
  gene cluster in Mtb, previously implicated in resistance to oxidative stress
  and survival in macrophages, encodes the biosynthesis of acyl-oxazolones.
  Heterologous expression of tyzA (Rv2336), tyzB (Rv2338c) and tyzC (Rv2337c)
  resulted in the biosynthesis of C12:0-tyrazolone as the predominant compound,
  and the C12:0-tyrazolone was identified in Mtb lipid extracts. TyzA catalyzed
  the N-acylation of l-amino acids, with highest specificity for l-Tyr and l-Phe
  and lauroyl-CoA (*k*cat/*K*M = 5.9 ± 0.8 × 10^3 M-1s-1). In cell extracts,
  TyzC, a flavin-dependent oxidase (FDO) of the nitroreductase (NTR)
  superfamily, catalyzed the O2-dependent desaturation of the N-acyl-L-Tyr
  produced by TyzA, while TyzB, a ThiF homolog, catalyzed its ATP-dependent
  cyclization. The substrate preference of TyzB and TyzC appear to determine the
  identity of the acyl-oxazolone. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the NTR
  superfamily includes a large number of broadly distributed FDOs, including
  five in Mtb that likely catalyze the desaturation of lipid species. Finally,
  TCA1, a molecule with activity against drug-resistant and persistent
  tuberculosis, failed to inhibit the cyclization activity of TyzB, the proposed
  secondary target of TCA1. Overall, this study identifies a novel class of Mtb
  lipids, clarifies the role of a potential drug target, and expands our
  understanding of the NTR superfamily."
