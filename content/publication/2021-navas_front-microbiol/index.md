abstract: The valorization of lignin, a major component of plant-derived
  biomass, is essential to sustainable biorefining. We identified the major
  monoaromatic compounds present in black liquor, a lignin-rich stream generated
  in the kraft pulping process, and investigated their bacterial transformation.
  Among tested solvents, acetone extracted the greatest amount of monoaromatic
  compounds from softwood black liquor, with guaiacol, vanillin, and
  acetovanillone, in an approximately 4:3:2 ratio, constituting ~90% of the
  total extracted monoaromatic content. 4-Ethanol guaiacol, vanillate, and
  4-propanol guaiacol were also present. Bacterial strains that grew on minimal
  media supplemented with the BL extracts at 1mM total aromatic compounds
  included *Pseudomonas putida* KT2442, *Sphingobium* sp. SYK-6, and
  *Rhodococcus rhodochrous* EP4. By contrast, the extracts inhibited the growth
  of *Rhodococcus jostii* RHA1 and *Rhodococcus opacus* PD630, strains
  extensively studied for lignin valorization. Of the strains that grew on the
  extracts, only *R. rhodochrous* GD01 and GD02, isolated for their ability to
  grow on acetovanillone, depleted the major extracted monoaromatics. Genomic
  analyses revealed that EP4, GD01, and GD02 share an average nucleotide
  identity (ANI) of 98% and that GD01 and GD02 harbor a predicted
  three-component carboxylase not present in EP4. A representative carboxylase
  gene was upregulated ~100-fold during growth of GD02 on a mixture of the BL
  monoaromatics, consistent with the involvement of the enzyme in acetovanillone
  catabolism. More generally, quantitative RT-PCR indicated that GD02
  catabolizes the BL compounds in a convergent manner *via* the Î²-ketoadipate
  pathway. Overall, these studies help define the catabolic capabilities of
  potential biocatalytic strains, describe new isolates able to catabolize the
  major monoaromatic components of BL, including acetovanillone, and facilitate
  the design of biocatalysts to valorize under-utilized components of industrial
  lignin streams.
