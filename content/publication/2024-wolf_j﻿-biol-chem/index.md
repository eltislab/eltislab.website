abstract: "Cytochromes P450 (P450s) are a superfamily of heme-containing enzymes
  possessing a broad range of monooxygenase activities. One such activity
  is *O*-demethylation, an essential and rate-determining step in emerging
  strategies to valorize lignin that employ carbon–carbon bond cleavage. We
  recently identified PbdA, a P450 from *Rhodococcus jostii* RHA1, and PbdB, its
  cognate reductase, which catalyze the *O*-demethylation of *para*-methoxylated
  benzoates (*p*-MBAs) to initiate growth of RHA1 on these compounds. PbdA had
  the highest affinity (*K*d = 3.8 ± 0.6 μM) and apparent specificity
  (*k*cat/*K*M = 20,000 ± 3000 M-1 s-1) for *p-*MBA. The enzyme
  also *O*-demethylated two related lignin-derived aromatic compounds with
  remarkable efficiency: veratrate and isovanillate. PbdA also catalyzed the
  hydroxylation and dehydrogenation of *p-*ethylbenzoate even though RHA1 did
  not grow on this compound. Atomic-resolution structures of PbdA in complex
  with *p*-MBA, *p-*ethylbenzoate, and veratrate revealed a cluster of three
  residues that form hydrogen bonds with the substrates’ carboxylate: Ser87,
  Ser237, and Arg84. Substitution of these residues resulted in lower affinity
  and *O*-demethylation activity on *p*-MBA as well as increased affinity for
  the acetyl analog, *p-*methoxyacetophenone. The S87A and S237A variants of
  PbdA also catalyzed the *O*-demethylation of an aldehyde analog
  of *p*-MBA, *p*-methoxy-benzaldehyde, while the R84M variant did not, despite
  binding this compound with high affinity. These results suggest that Ser87,
  Ser237, and Arg84 are not only important determinants of specificity but also
  help to orientate that substrate correctly in the active site. This study
  facilitates the design of biocatalysts for lignin valorization."
