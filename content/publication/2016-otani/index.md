abstract: "CouR, a MarR-type transcriptional repressor, regulates the *cou* genes, encoding p-hydroxycinnamate catabolism in the soil bacterium *Rhodococcus jostii* RHA1. The CouR dimer bound two molecules of the catabolite *p*-coumaroyl-CoA (*K*<sub>d</sub> = 11 ± 1 μM). The presence of *p*-coumaroyl-CoA, but neither *p*-coumarate nor CoASH, abrogated CouR's binding to its operator DNA *in vitro*. The crystal structures of ligand-free CouR and its *p*-coumaroyl-CoA-bound form showed no significant conformational differences, in contrast to other MarR regulators. The CouR-*p*-coumaroyl-CoA structure revealed two ligand molecules bound to the CouR dimer with their phenolic moieties occupying equivalent hydrophobic pockets in each protomer and their CoA moieties adopting non-equivalent positions to mask the regulator's predicted DNA-binding surface. More specifically, the CoA phosphates formed salt bridges with predicted DNA-binding residues Arg36 and Arg38, changing the overall charge of the DNA-binding surface. The substitution of either arginine with alanine completely abrogated the ability of CouR to bind DNA. By contrast, the R36A/R38A double variant retained a relatively high affinity for p-coumaroyl-CoA (*K*<sub>d</sub> = 89 ± 6 μM). Together, our data point to a novel mechanism of action in which the ligand abrogates the repressor's ability to bind DNA by steric occlusion of key DNA-binding residues and charge repulsion of the DNA backbone.
