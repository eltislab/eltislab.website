abstract: A test abstract. **Italics** are a way to emphasise key points in a
  printed text, to identify many types of creative works, to cite foreign words
  or phrases, or, when quoting a speaker, a way to show which words they
  stressed. One manual of English usage described **italics** as "the print
  equivalent of underlining".
