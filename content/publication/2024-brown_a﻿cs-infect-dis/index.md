abstract: Cholesterol is a critical growth substrate for *Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis* (Mtb) during infection, and the cholesterol catabolic pathway
  has been targeted for the development of new antimycobacterial agents. A key
  metabolite in cholesterol catabolism is
  3aα-H-4α(3'-propanoate)-7aβ-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione (HIP). Many of the
  HIP metabolites are acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters, whose accumulation in
  deletion mutants can cause cholesterol-mediated toxicity. We used LC-MS/MS
  analysis to demonstrate that deletion of genes involved in HIP catabolism
  leads to acyl-CoA accumulation with concomitant depletion of free CoASH,
  leading to dysregulation of central metabolic pathways. CoASH and acyl-CoAs
  inhibited PanK, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the transformation
  of pantothenate to CoASH. Inhibition was competitive with respect to ATP
  with *K*ic values ranging from 9 μM for CoASH to 57 μM for small acyl-CoAs and
  180 ± 30 μM for cholesterol-derived acyl-CoA. These findings link two critical
  metabolic pathways and suggest that therapeutics targeting cholesterol
  catabolic enzymes could both prevent the utilization of an important growth
  substrate and simultaneously sequester CoA from essential cellular processes,
  leading to bacterial toxicity.
