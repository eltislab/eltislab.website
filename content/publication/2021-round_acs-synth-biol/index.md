abstract: The development of microbial cell factories requires robust synthetic
  biology tools to reduce design uncertainty and accelerate the
  design-build-test-learn process. Herein, we developed a suite of integrative
  genetic tools to facilitate the engineering of *Rhodococcus*, a genus of
  bacteria with considerable biocatalytic potential. We first created pRIME, a
  modular, copy-controlled integrative-vector, to provide a robust platform for
  strain engineering and characterizing genetic parts. This vector was then
  employed to benchmark a series of strong promoters. We found PM6 to be the
  strongest constitutive rhodococcal promoter, 2.5- to 3-fold stronger than the
  next in our study, while overall promoter activities ranged 23-fold between
  the weakest and strongest promoters during exponential growth. Next, we used
  an optimized variant of PM6 to develop hybrid-promoters and integrative
  vectors to allow for tetracycline-inducible gene expression in *Rhodococcus*.
  The best of the resulting hybrid-promoters maintained a maximal activity of
  ∼50% of PM6 and displayed an induction factor of ∼40-fold. Finally, we
  developed and implemented a uLoop-derived Golden Gate assembly strategy for
  high-throughput DNA assembly in *Rhodococcus*. To demonstrate the utility of
  our approaches, pRIME was used to engineer *Rhodococcus jostii* RHA1 to grow
  on vanillin at concentrations 10-fold higher than what the wild-type strain
  tolerated. Overall, this study provides a suite of tools that will accelerate
  the engineering of *Rhodococcus* for various biocatalytic applications,
  including the sustainable production of chemicals from lignin-derived
  aromatics.
